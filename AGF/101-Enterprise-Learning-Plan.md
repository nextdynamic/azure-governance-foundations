Enterprise Learning Plan
========================

Customer Situation
------------------

Describe the business goals. How will the learning and development support the
business goals?

Kroger is looking to transform the retail industry through a series of
technologies created by Sunrise Technologies (Kroger’s commercial group). Kroger
plans to license its proprietary retail technology to third parties, these
include Edghe shelves, Food at Safe Temperatures (FAST) and Zooter cameras. The
focus of this engagement is around an offering called “Retail as a Service”
which includes a number of services like EDGE, LEAP and Scan, Bag and Go. As
part of this strategy, Kroger needs to train different groups within the
organization including Developers, IT Operations, Security, IT Architecture.

Skill Requirements
------------------

Describe the skills required to meet the business goals.

In order to accomplish their business goals, Kroger has a need to develop
specific skills in Application Modernization (Containers, Functions, API
Management, Application Insights) along with Cloud Infrastructure Fundamentals
(Compute, Storage, Networking, Backup, Monitoring) for staff that have not yet
had the opportunity to work with Azure. The three role types currently
identified are Azure Solution Architects, Azure Administrators and Azure
Developers.

They plan to train as many as 4000 people total in different cities though
primarily in the Cincinnati area. The initial T1 Instructor-led training will
likely be limited to 50 peple.
