Assessment and Gap Analysis
---------------------------

The CCoE requires people, processes, and technology with the capabilities needed
for the scope of this offering. Before committees can operate effectively, they
must become subject matter experts in the Azure offerings that relate to the
committee’s purview. The Partner will work with the customer to assess the skill
level of the members of committees as well as the customer’s current Azure
environment. While the Partner may act as a committee member in these groups it
is of paramount importance that the customer be knowledgeable of the appropriate
Azure offerings and act as their own agents in creating policies.

Any training or workshops required to bring committee members up to the
appropriate level of expertise will be included in the scope of work from the
Partner. The level of effort necessary to bring the customer and their
environment up to the needed functionality to support CCoE will be determined
and added to offering by the Partner. These workshops can generally be delivered
in parallel if needed in the interest of time since most of the topics will not
include members of other committees.

Skill Requirements
------------------

Describe the skills required to meet the business goals.

In order to accomplish their business goals, XYZ has a need to help ramp up
specific skills in Application Modernization (Containers, Functions, API
Management, Application Insights) along with some Cloud Infrastructure
Fundamentals (Compute, Storage, Networking, Backup, Monitoring) for staff that
have not yet had the opportunity to work with Azure. They plan to train 100
people total in different cities: Hong Kong, Tokyo and Shanghai.

 Recommended Learning Plans
---------------------------

*Training Menu*

The training menu is divided into three tiers of training packages:
Foundational, Advanced Role-Based, and Advanced Workload-Based.

Tier 1 offers an introductory start to Azure with self-paced and instructor-led
options.

Tier 2 provides master Azure skills within more in-depth training with
self-paced MOOC and instructor-led options.

Tier 3 provides instructor-led and facilitated training for a deep dive into
Azure workloads with topic-based workshops and Hacks.

Both T2 and T3 are considered advanced level content.
