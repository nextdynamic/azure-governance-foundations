Assessment and Gap Analysis
---------------------------

The CCoE requires people, processes, and technology with the capabilities needed
for the scope of the AGF. Before committees can operate effectively, they must
become subject matter experts in the Azure offerings that relate to the
committee’s purview.

If you work directly with a Microsoft Customer Success Unit, or a Microsoft
Partner they will work with you to assess the skill level of the members of
committees as well as your current Azure environment (if any).

It is of paramount importance that the members of committee be knowledgeable of
the appropriate Azure offerings and act as their own agents in creating
policies.

If you work directly with a Microsoft Customer Success Unit, or a Microsoft
Partner, any training or workshops required to bring committee members up to the
appropriate level of expertise will be included in an Enterprise Skills
Initiative created by your Cloud Solution Architect or the scope of work from
the Partner. Generally speaking if you are working with either of these groups,
you will not need to focus on this section of the AGF as this effort will be
completed by the CSU or partner.

If you do not work with either of these, you will need to go through a skills
gap exercise and determine what training will be required by the members of the
CCoE and then create an appropriate learning plan for your Enterprise. What
follows is a sample plan that you can use as a framework. Please tailor it to
fit your needs.

NOTE: When planning the training activities or workshops, they can generally be
delivered in parallel if needed and in the interest of time since most of the
topics will not require members of other committees.

Skill Requirements
------------------

If you are creating your own plan, you may find it helpful to describe the
skills required to meet the business goals. This will allow you to clearly see
the objectives at the highest levels and seek appropriate sign-off.

For Example:

In order to accomplish their business goals, Contoso has a need to help ramp up
specific skills in Application Modernization (Containers, Functions, API
Management, Application Insights) along with some Cloud Infrastructure
Fundamentals (Compute, Storage, Networking, Backup, Monitoring) for staff that
have not yet had the opportunity to work with those aspects of Azure. They plan
to train 130 people total in different cities: New York, Frankfort and Shanghai.
They want to complete all the training in the next 90 days.

Recommended Learning Plans
--------------------------

*Training Menu*

Creating a training menu provides attendees and management with a simple
reference that gives insight into the overall training plan by breaking the
learning into three tiers which relate to basic, intermediate and advanced.

The training menu is divided into three tiers of training packages:

-   Foundational

-   Advanced Role-Based

-   Advanced Workload-Based.

Tier 1 offers an introductory start to Azure with self-paced and instructor-led
options.

Tier 2 provides master Azure skills within more in-depth training with
self-paced MOOC and instructor-led options.

Tier 3 provides instructor-led and facilitated training for a deep dive into
Azure workloads with topic-based workshops and/or Hackathons.

Foundational (T1)
-----------------

T1 training can be accomplished as a self-paced (online) effort or it can be
delivered as Instructor-Led training.

NOTE: Self-paced learning, while convenient, also requires proper planning and
accountability. The Azure Administrator course, for example, can take 40 hours
to complete. Simply assigning this training to CCoE members without providing
them with focused time away from their other activities and a system of
accountability is a prescription for failure. To ensure success in self-paced
training, treat it with the same respect you would an instructor-led course.

Advanced Role-based (T2)
------------------------

T2 training is aligned to specific roles and can also be accomplished as a
self-paced (online) effort or it can be delivered as Instructor-Led training. T2
training aligns with Microsoft Azure Certifications and you should strongly
consider using these certifications as one of your measure (though not the only)
of the successful completion of these efforts.

1.  **Available through Microsoft Learning Partners**

    -   Online courses (available for free)

Advanced Workload-based (T3)
----------------------------

>   T3 level trainings are deep dives into specific Azure workloads with
>   topic-based workshops and Hacks. Given the in-depth nature, these are not
>   available as self-paced learning. Training at this level of depth requires
>   experienced training resources and is certainly the most challenging for an
>   organization to deliver on their own. Most customers will need to make sure
>   of Microsoft or Microsoft Partner resources to accomplish this level.
