Membership
----------

The CCoE, as a whole, is composed of a representative of each committee and each
committee should contain at least one member (but generally not more than five).
Some committees will naturally share memberships where appropriate. For example,
a member of the Security committee would also be at home as a member of the
product Catalog committee (since the certification of products in the catalog
has a security element).

There should also be at least one project manager (or SCRUM manager) for each
committee as well as the CCoE. The same PM can manage the responsibility across
multiple committees if time/resourcing permits. In larger organizations the
creation of a Project Management Committee would not be out of place.

Charter

Committee interaction
---------------------

The CCoE should operate in such a way that committees are empowered to determine
appropriate policies for themselves. Once these policies have been identified by
a committee, they should be raised to the CCoE to be ratified. While each
committee should determine their own destiny, as it relates to their own
governance and business needs, the complexity of cloud requires a wide exposure
to the CCoE to ensure that the recommendations of the committee do not cause
unintended consequences or affect other committeesâ€™ policies.

Once policies are ratified by the CCoE they will be implemented by the
recommending committee or the Platform committee, typically in the form of Azure
Policies or Azure Blueprints.

Where do I go from here?
------------------------

Governance is crucial to the success of Azure. This article targets the
technical implementation of an enterprise scaffold but only touches on the
broader process and relationships between the components. Policy governance
flows from the top down and is determined by what the business wants to achieve.
Naturally, the creation of a governance model for Azure includes representatives
from IT, but more importantly it should have strong representation from business
group leaders, and security and risk management. In the end, an enterprise
scaffold is about mitigating business risk to facilitate an organization's
mission and objectives

Now that you have learned about subscription governance, it's time to see these
recommendations in practice. See [Examples of implementing Azure subscription
governance](https://github.com/rdendtler/architecture-center/blob/eca/scaffold-v2/docs/cloud-adoption/appendix/azure-scaffold-examples.md).
